# Future Price Forecasting

One of my recent projects is called Future Price Forecasting. It's a web based application designed to predict future prices of products based on historical data.
The system allows users to input a product name and year, and backend calculates and displays future price predictions.

# Technologies used
For this project,I used java and mySQL for the backend. Where the logic for price forecasting is implemented. The frontend was build using HTML, CSS, Boostrap and
javascript to provide a user-friendly interface. The forecasting model relies on historical price data stored in a mySQL database. Which is queried using SQL to 
calculate future trends.
